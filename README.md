# Team4DataOptimisation
A Github Repo for Team 4 of Data Engineering Class's Data Optimisation Project 


Customistation can be done inside of the code in order to change number of trials and number of loops. 
The code is a Population-Based Incremental Learning which is a method of optimisation through random generation. Our Code is made via Matlab. Our code works on the idea of connections and limited numbers of them. We proform a calculation on a random generation and compare that against our Probability Vector in order to generate our Randomised Solution. One of the problems is the fact that our Probability Vector always maximises to 1 when in reality, in order to assure the most efficent code, we should impliment some sort of mutation factor which shifts the probabilty vector randomly in some direction.
